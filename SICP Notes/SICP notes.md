# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

## Foreward

If art interprets our dreams, the computer executes them in the guise of programs.

## Preface to the First Edition

*What is computer science?*

Underlying our approach to this subject is our conviction that "computer science" is not a science and that its significane has little to do with computers. **The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think.** The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called **procedural epistemology** -- the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. **Mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation  provides a framework for dealing with notions of "how to."**

## Chapter 1 Building Abstractions with Procedures
